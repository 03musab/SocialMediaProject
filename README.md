# Social Media Analysis Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of social media data (tweets) using a simulated MapReduce workflow in R. The processed data is then visualized in an interactive web dashboard built with Python's Dash framework.

The analysis pipeline extracts key insights, including word frequency, sentiment trends over time, and user engagement metrics.

## Features

- **Text Analysis**: Displays the most frequently used words from the dataset, processed via a MapReduce word count job.
- **User Performance**: Ranks the most engaged users based on the total number of likes and retweets they received.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Visualizes the daily average sentiment trend, allowing for the identification of patterns over time.
- **Key Metrics Summary**: Provides at-a-glance statistics for total tweets, unique users, and average engagement.

## Technology Stack

- **Data Processing**: R, with a simulation of MapReduce concepts for distributed data analysis.
- **Dashboard**: Python, Dash, Plotly
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the dashboard locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and an IDE like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) and `pip`

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-dashboard.git
cd social-media-dashboard
```

### Step 2: Run the R Analysis Scripts

The Python dashboard depends on CSV files generated by the R scripts. You must run them in the correct order.

1.  **Place your raw data file** (e.g., `tweets.csv`) in the project root directory.
2.  Open the R scripts in RStudio.
3.  Run the scripts sequentially to perform cleaning, processing, and MapReduce simulations:
    - `01_preprocessing.R`
    - `03_data_preparation_for_mapreduce.R`
    - `04_mapreduce_simulation.R`

    This will generate the required `*.csv` output files in the project directory.

### Step 3: Set Up Python Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Launch the Dash Dashboard

Once the R scripts have been run and the Python environment is set up, you can start the web application.

```bash
python full_dashboard.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:8050/** to view the dashboard.
